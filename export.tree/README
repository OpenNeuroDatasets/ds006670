### Subjects

All animal procedures complied with the UK Animals and Scientific Procedures Act 1986 and were approved by the local ethical committee at King’s College London (KCL). Homozygous C3ar1-/- mice were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and kindly provided by Dr. Bao Lu and Prof. Craig Gerard (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (Humbles et al. 2000). These mice were subsequently backcrossed onto the C57BL/6J strain for at least 12 generations and maintained on a C57BL/6J background in Professor Wuding Zhou’s laboratory at KCL. For this study, cryopreserved stocks were rederived at KCL and crossed to C57BL/6J mice purchased from Charles River to refresh the genetic background following Jackson’s Laboratories line refreshing protocol.

Experimental animals (C3ar1-/- and C3ar1+/+ littermates) were generated through heterozygote incrosses and resulting genotypes followed Mendelian ratios. The heterozygote breeders were generated by outcrossing heterozygous mice to bought wild-type Charles River C57BL/6Js. The breeders used to produce the experimental animals were derived either from the first, second or third of these outcrosses. Sibling crosses were not conducted, and parental age was between 2–4 months to minimise genetic drift.

Experimental mice were housed in individually ventilated cages under controlled temperature (20–25°C), humidity (50–60%), and a 12-hour light-dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM, lights off at 7:00 PM). Environmental enrichment included nesting materials, tunnels, and chew sticks. Mice had ad libitum access to irradiated rodent chow and autoclaved water. Animals were group-housed (2–4 mice per cage), with males and females housed separately after weaning (PND21±2). Genotyping was conducted on ear biopsy DNA by Transnetyx using probes targeting the neomycin cassette for the mutant allele and intron 1 for the wild-type allele. No mismatches were identified through double-genotyping 20% of the study cohorts.

### Apparatus

Mice were imaged using a Bruker BioSpec 9.4 T scanner with an 86-mm volume resonator for transmission and a 4-channel surface array coil. Anaesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in medical air (1 L/min) and oxygen (0.4 L/min), maintained at 2% but adjusted based on respiration rates. The respiration rate was monitored with a pressure sensor, and temperature was monitored with a rectal thermometer and maintained at 36–37°C using a water circulation system.


### Additional data acquired

Open field, novel object recognition, elevated plus maze and prepulse inhibition tests were performed shortly before the adulthood scan.
